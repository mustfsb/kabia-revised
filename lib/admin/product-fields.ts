/**
 * The product editor's column contract, in one place.
 *
 * A product field has to exist in four places to work: the form renders it, the
 * Zod schema keeps it, the save payload writes it, and the detail select reads
 * it back. A field present in three of the four fails silently — it either does
 * not save, or saves and then shows a stale value on reload.
 *
 * `products.certification` was present in none of them while being NOT NULL
 * with no database default, so every product creation failed with SQLSTATE
 * 23502 and the only message the operator saw was the generic "Zorunlu bir alan
 * boş bırakılamaz." with no field to point at.
 *
 * Pure module: no Supabase, no Next, no `server-only`, so the contract itself
 * is testable.
 */

/**
 * `products` columns that are NOT NULL with **no database default**. An insert
 * omitting any of these fails with 23502.
 *
 * Sources: 20260730194034_create_schema.sql (the first seven) and
 * 20260805000000_kabia_taxonomy.sql, which added `certification` nullable,
 * backfilled it, then set NOT NULL without ever giving it a default.
 *
 * `source` is deliberately absent: it is NOT NULL but the taxonomy migration
 * gave it `default 'ciftlik'`, so an insert omitting it succeeds — silently
 * filing the product under the farm, which is why the editor writes it anyway.
